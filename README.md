# wedding-app

The wedding industry is a massive and growing market worldwide, but planning and managing a wedding can be stressful and time-consuming. This project aims to create a wedding app that helps to solve common issues related to wedding events.

The wedding planning app will be designed to make it easy for couples to plan and organize their wedding events. The app will provide a platform for couples to create a checklist of tasks that need to be done before, during, and after the wedding. The app will also offer a comprehensive directory of vendors such as florists, photographers, caterers, and other service providers that can be used for the wedding event.

In addition to the vendor directory, the wedding planning app will also offer a platform for couples to manage their guest lists, invitations, and RSVPs. The app will have features that allow couples to customize their wedding invitations, track responses, and send reminders to guests who haven't responded.

Furthermore, the app will provide a timeline and countdown to the wedding day, allowing couples to stay on track with their wedding planning. The app will also offer a budget calculator, which will help couples to stay within their budget, and manage all wedding expenses. The app will also provide a platform for guests to share photos and comments during and after the wedding, creating a virtual wedding album.

Overall, this wedding planning app will provide a one-stop solution for couples to plan, organize, and manage their wedding events, reducing stress and saving time.
